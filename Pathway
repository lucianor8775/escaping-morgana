  He is sound asleep. In his dream he is envisioning a growing sword; he hears whispers saying his name, Arthur, Arthur, ARTHURRR.

[The whispers begin to get louder and louder, becoming screams until he wakes up.He wakes up and discovers his family eating in the living room without him]

 Arthur; it's my birthday [in a cheerful tone].

What are we doing ? [Arthur asked]

[Mother sips coffee]

 “We have more important issues; we can handle your birthday another time.”

[Father says]

 Arthur; it's always another time; we always have issues. When will we get to do the things that I want to do? It's my special day.

Jessica: Arthur [in a worried tone]

Arthur: No, Jessica, they always do this; they always think about their children last.

Jessica and Arthur calm down.

[Mother says]

Arthur; NO, i'm leaving.

[He goes to his room, slams the door, and cries himself to sleep]
