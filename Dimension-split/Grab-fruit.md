# you've made the animals mad!!

[Arthur picks the fruit off the ground, and when he looks up he notices that the animals expressions have changed]

animals:"why are you stealing!! its only your first day here and we have already caught you stealing."

Arthur: i swear i wasnt doing it on purpose, i had no idea that apple even belonged to you!! maybe you should try picking up after yourself instead of lashing out on others.
