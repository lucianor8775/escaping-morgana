# Wake up
Arthur has a nightmare about falling in an endless loop, and people are laughing. *BOOM hits the ground*

 He wakes up at 3 AM, the house is barren, and he has a chilling feeling down their back. Something is off. It's like someone lurking in the shadows with no physical form

Arthur walks back in towards his room; the game station is on but wasn't turned on.
