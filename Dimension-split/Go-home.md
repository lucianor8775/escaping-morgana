# Go home
Lady ; Im going to ask you again.

[with a meancing face]

Lady;Play my game or go home ?

Arthur; How many times do you want me to reiterate what I just said, lady, that I want to go home?

Lady ; you sure ?
[She summoned the main world through a gateway. When Arthur turns around, he finds his family dead and the sky was red and lifeless.]

Arthur; My family, what did you do ![with sadness in his voice]

Lady; If you play my games you will get to see them again.

Lady; Would you like to participate in my games?

Arthur; yes
