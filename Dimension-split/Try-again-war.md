He knew he should of dodged better.  He was so close that time!  Then, outta nowhere, two buttons popped into existence right in front of him. One was green and said "Retry," all simple like. The other was red and screamed "New Game," all fancy with glowing edges.


Arthur didn't even think. He slammed his fist down on the green "Retry" button.  He wasn't going down like that.  He had to get this right.  He had to win, for Jessica, for his mom.  He had to get back home, even if it was all red and messed up now.


Suddenly, he was back in the cockpit, the same clunky fighter jet, the same annoying countdown. This time, he was ready.  He gripped the control stick tighter, his knuckles white.

The voice boomed in his ears, and Arthur shot off like a rocket. This time, he wasn't just blasting lasers all willy-nilly. He was thinking, strategizing He remembered what the voice system said last time. "Incoming lasers, stay clear!"  Okay, so he needed to be more careful.  He weaved between enemy fire, doing barrel rolls and loop-de-loops like some kinda pro pilot, which he totally wasn't.  He targeted the planes that were aiming at him first, taking them out one by one

And he have finally won the game.
