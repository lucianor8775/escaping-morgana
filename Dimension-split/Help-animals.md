Arthur: it looks like you guys could use a hand. do you wnat help with collecting fruits?

Animals: "yes please it would help us a ton. you can start by picking apples off those trees over there."

Arthur: im starting to really like this place. but im starting to hear something very faint in the distance. [Arthur begins to hear a beeping noise in the distance]

Arthur: is that? i think i hear my alarm in the distance. i think my alarm is going off.
