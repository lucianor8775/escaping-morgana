[Arthur looks around and sees people standing around his bed with gifts, party hats, and a cake]

family:"SURPISE!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY ARTHUR!!"

Arthur: what is this? i thought that you guys said that we werent able to celebrate this year?

mom:"im so sorry that we made you go to bed upset, we just wanted to surprise you but, it didnt go as planned."

Arthur: its okay, i just had thought that you guys forgot or didnt give it much thought because you guys were so busy.
