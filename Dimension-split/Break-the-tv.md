# Break the tv
Arthur; what the heck?
[Arthor walks to the station and grabs his bat that was near his baseball uniform, He uses his bat to break the TV.]


Arthur; FINALLY
[ Arthor feels his body disintegrating; he screams for help.]


Arthur: What's happening to me, Help?


[Arthur yells, but it's too late; he reapears in this dungeon-like place with a throw covered with green aura.]


Witch ; Arthur


Arthur; you look familiar; you are that monster I see in my nightmares.
You are that green witch that always causes me despair, and you always say a letter repeatedly.


Witch ; You're getting it now!


Arthur ; M,O,R,G,A,N,A. MORGANA.


Morgana ; You should've played my game.
[She walks towards Arthur and she uses her magic to make him kneel down; she puts her index finger on Arthur's forehead, and BOOM!]
