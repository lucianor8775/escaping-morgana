With a blink of a flash, he’s falling. The scene is stunning; he  pass through every game, every fictional reality, falling and falling over and over again.

Arthur is both stunned and amazed; he is confused; he has fallen through all the games within his system. He doesn’t believe; who would? He was just asleep 5 minutes ago.

He lands in a deep, fiery pit—that's barren, to be exact; he can feel the heat on his skin boiling. He tries to run, but Edge falls, and he’s close to falling out. He has been saved by this woman; she’s beautiful; she has long brunette hair, bright green eyes comparable to emeralds, and is tall about 6’0. She picks up Arthur. What are you doing in these forgotten lands? Arthur, I can do the same for you, beautiful lady.

Lady, arrogant, i see nothing changed.

Arthur; Whuuu

Arthur; You are someone I have never met in my life.

Lady ; I'll give you the option to play my games and win a sizable prize, or you can return home and be with your family.
