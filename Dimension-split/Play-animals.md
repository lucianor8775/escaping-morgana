Arthur: i go through the door to find myself in animal crossing

Arthur: The animals here are very nice. I hope I can become friends with them. I know this is a
dream, but I want to make the most of it before returning to my horrible reality.

Arthur: as i look around i notice that it is very vibrant. I think im gonna like this place a lot.
